        <h1>Magic Mirror</h1>
        <img src="maggicmirror.webp" height="500" width="1000">
        <p>The diminutive ruler, desperate to become king, needs to marry a princess, and the Magic Mirror is his high-tech (for
        the medieval setting, at least) solution. The Mirror itself is depicted as a framed object, almost like a television
        screen displaying images and information.The Magic Mirror is the same mirror seen in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. As a mirror, he has no identifiable gender,
        but his masculine voice leads viewers to see him as male. Mirror has a fairly minor role but appears in most of the
        Shrek films to date.The Magic Mirror in the Shrek franchise is a witty and magical character who serves as Lord Farquaad’s advisor,
        providing him with information and guidance, especially in choosing a suitable princess to marry. Inspired by the
        classic fairy tale mirror from "Snow White," this enchanted mirror displays a face that can change expressions and
        offers a humorous, sarcastic personality that adds a unique charm to the films. Beyond the movies, the Magic Mirror has
        a significant role in the Shrek video game adaptation, acting as a guide who offers tips, hints, and tutorials to
        players, often breaking the fourth wall with its witty remarks. Voiced by Chris Miller, the character blends magical
        abilities—such as showing images from distant places and somewhat predicting the future—with sharp humor, making it an
        entertaining and memorable part of the Shrek universe. Though a minor character, the Magic Mirror’s blend of wisdom and
        sass plays a vital role in advancing the story and entertaining audiences across different media format.</p>
